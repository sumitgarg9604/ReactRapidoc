    # Introduction

    Petstore illustrate the typical design decisions and tradeoffs a developer makes when building an enterprise application. 
    The demo shows how to document REST API services **OpenAPI format** and is based on
    [Petstore sample](http://petstore.swagger.io/) by [swagger.io](http://swagger.io) team.
    It was further **extended** by [ReDoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) Team.

    ## Webhook Categories

    The Webhook are divided in 3 separate categories, to make things easy to discover. 

    Below is how these APIs are arranged

      - Subscription Created

      - Subscription Cancel

    ## API Operations
      
    Below is the list of supported operations

      - Update an existing pet
      - Add a new pet to the store
      - Find Pet by ID
      - Updates a pet in the store
      - Deletes a pet
      - Upload an pet image
      - Finds Pets by status
      - Finds Pets by tags

    ### Store Operations

    Below is the list of supported operations

      - Get pet inventory by status
      - Place an order for a pet
      - Find purchase order by ID
      - Delete purchase order

    ### User Operations

    Below is the list of supported operations

      - Create User
      - Login and Logout of user
      - Get user by user name
      - Update user
      - Delete user

    # Example

    Below is a small code sample how to sender this OpenAPI spec using RapiDoc

    ```html
      <!doctype html> <!-- Important: must specify -->
      <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8"> <!-- Important: rapi-doc uses utf8 characters -->
        <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/rapidoc/dist/rapidoc-min.js"></script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <rapi-doc 
          spec-url = "https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json" 
        > </rapi-doc>
      </body> 
      </html>
    ```

    # OpenAPI Version

    You can find the version of OpenAPI spec from the `version` object

    ```yaml
      openapi: 3.0.2
      info:
        version: '1.0'
        title: Server Variables
      ...  
    ```

    # Authentication

    Petstore offers two forms of authentication:
      
      - API Key
      - OAuth2

    OAuth2 - an open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple
    and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications.
